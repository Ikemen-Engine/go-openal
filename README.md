OpenAL bindings for Go.
--------------------
Windows version of the library `OpenAL32.dll` was renamed to avoid conflicts when both versions of the library are in the same folder.

The 64-bit version was renamed to `SoftOpenAL64.dll`  
The 32-bit version was renamed to `SoftOpenAL32.dll`

`.a` files for the modified dll names are included in `openal/lib`.
